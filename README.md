# Object-Detection
1. Bolt Detection:
The aim was to detect nuts and bolts (used the label bolts commonly as they always occur together). Used Detecto Object Detection model here but as the dataset was significantly 
small, the model appears confused on the number of bolts in the figure( has difficulty telling how many bolts are actually there in the image).
